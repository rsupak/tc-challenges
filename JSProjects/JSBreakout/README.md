Breakout! with Javascript

## Description

Breakout begins with eight rows of bricks, with each two rows a different color. The color order from the bottom up is yellow, green, orange and red. Using a single ball, the player must knock down as many bricks as possible by using the walls and/or the paddle below to ricochet the ball against the bricks and eliminate them. If the player's paddle misses the ball's rebound, he or she will lose a turn. The player has three turns to try to clear two screens of bricks. Yellow bricks earn one point each, green bricks earn three points, orange bricks earn five points and the top-level red bricks score seven points each. Ball speed increases at specific intervals: after four hits, after twelve hits, and after making contact with the orange and red rows.

## Notes
I've implemented all of the required tasks successfully except multiball. Currently there is a bug that does not
allow the 2nd ball to update with the rest of the game loop. I am currently working through the issue. In order
to make the game more enjoyable, sound and a high score function have been added.
