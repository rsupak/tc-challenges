### Requirements

Requires Ruby 2.1+ due the use of required keyword arguments.

### Setup

Run `bundle install` from the working directory.  This is only needed if you intend to run the tests â€” the library itself uses only Ruby core and stdlib.

### Tests

You can run the test suite with `bin/rake` or `bin/rake spec`.
You can run an individual test file with e.g. `bin/rspec spec/foo_spec.rb`.
