Cocktail Sort

### Description

Cocktail_sort is a bi-directional bubble sort variant.
Like bubble sort, cocktail sort works by iterating through the list,
comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if theyâ€™re in the wrong
order. Cocktail sort also shares the same worst case time complexity
as its predecessor, O(n^2). This can be readily seen when the largest
and smallest numbers are grouped together on their unsorted ends of
the array. (i.e. [10,10,10,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0,0,0]).

## Prerequisites
1. Ruby 2.5.x
2. Bundler
3. Rspec

## Local Deployment
```bash
touch Gemfile
```
using your text editor add the following dependencies to the Gemfile

```
  source "https://rubygems.org"

  gem "byebug"
  gem "rspec", "~> 3.2.0"
  gem "pry"
```


## Production Build and Installation
How to build the application for use
```bash
bundle install --binstubs
bin/rspec --init
```

### Manual Deployment Notes
because this particular rspec uses `require_relative` 
all files to be tested should also be in the spec directory

## Running Tests
```bash
bundle exec rspec spec/cocktail_sort_spec.rb
```
