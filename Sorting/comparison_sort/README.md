Binary Insertion Sort

### Description

A comparison sort is a type of sorting algorithm that only reads the list
elements through a single abstract comparison operation (often a "less than
or equal to" operator or a three-way comparison) that determines which of two
elements should occur first in the final sorted list. The only requirement is
that the operator obey two of the properties of a total order:
1. if a ≤ b and b ≤ c then a ≤ c (transitivity)
2. for all a and b, either a ≤ b or b ≤ a (totalness or trichotomy).

### Some popular comparison sorts are:
Quicksort
Heapsort
Shellsort
Merge sort
Introsort
Insertion sort
Selection sort
Bubble sort
Odd–even sort
Cocktail shaker sort
Cycle sort
Merge insertion (Ford–Johnson) sort
Smoothsort
Timsort
