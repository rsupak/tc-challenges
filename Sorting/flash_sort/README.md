Flashsort

### Description
Flashsort is a distribution sorting algorithm showing linear computational
complexity O(n) for uniformly distributed data sets and relatively little
additional memory requirement. The basic idea behind flashsort is that in a
data set with a known distribution, it is easy to immediately estimate where
an element should be placed after sorting when the range of the set is known.
For example, if given a uniform data set where the minimum is 1 and the maximum
is 100 and 50 is an element of the set, itâ€™s reasonable to guess that 50 would
be near the middle of the set after it is sorted. This approximate location is
called a class.
