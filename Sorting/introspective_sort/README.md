Introspective Sort

### Description

Introsort or introspective sort is a hybrid sorting algorithm that provides both fast average performance and (asymptotically) optimal worst-case performance. It begins with quicksort and switches to heapsort when the recursion depth exceeds a level based on (the logarithm of) the number of elements being sorted. This combines the good parts of both algorithms, with practical performance comparable to quicksort on typical data sets and worst-case O(n log n) runtime due to the heap sort. Since both algorithms it uses are comparison sorts, it is also a comparison sort.


## Prerequisites

1. Ruby 2.5.x
2. Bundler
3. Rspec

## Local Deployment

```bash
touch Gemfile
```

using your text editor add the following dependencies to the Gemfile

```
  source "https://rubygems.org"

  gem "byebug"
  gem "rspec"
  gem "pry"
```

## Production Build and Installation

How to build the application for use

```bash
bundle install --binstubs
bin/rspec --init
```

### Manual Deployment Notes
The following command will run the sorting method from the main
directory.

```bash
ruby lib/introspective_sort.rb
```


## Running Tests

```bash
bundle exec rspec spec/introspective_sort_spec.rb
```
