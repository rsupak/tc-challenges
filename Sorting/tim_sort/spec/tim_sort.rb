# Hybrid sort method that takes advantage of the time complexity advantages
# inherent in the insertion and merge sort algorithms. For smaller sub-arrays
# insertion sort offers the most efficient sorting method, however, once the
# sub-arrays grow larger than 64 items, insertion sort becomes less efficient
# than merge sort. At this point merge sort takes over and completes the sort
# of the remaining sub-arrays. This efficiency relies on comparable sub-array
# sizes. Finally, as the smaller arrays are being structured from the original
# array into runs, The algorithm looks for natural ordered runs already present
# in the original array, and builds runs utilizing these natural ordered runs
# which will reduce the overall number of calls to the insertion sort method.
