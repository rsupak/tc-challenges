# topcoder challenges


Stack and Queue
Tech Stack: Ruby

Challenge Overview
This is the first in a series of challenges of learning basic computer science data structures in ruby. In the first step to 
this challenge we will create methods to build a stack and queue. You must complete all of the methods (provided) and get all 
the test in the Rspec file to pass. We will be adding more complex data structures as we go on. The is a github link for the 
four files are listed in the in the forum. There is a blank stack file and a test file. And then there is a black queue file 
and test file



Linked List
Tech Stack: Ruby

Challenge Overview
This is the second in a series of challenges of learning basic computer science data structures in ruby. In the second step to 
this challenge we will create methods to build a linked list. You must complete all of the methods (provided) and get all the 
test in the Rspec file to pass. We will be adding more complex data structures as we go on. There is a github link for the 
skeleton starter file and rspec test file in the forum. There will be a blind test file to prevent cheating. The blind test 
file will be exactly the same except the values for the nodes will be different.




Hash Table Part 1 - Chaining
Tech Stack: Ruby

Challenge Overview
This is the third in a series of challenges of learning computer science data structures in ruby. In the 3rd step to this 
challenge we will create methods to build a hash table. You must complete all of the methods (provided) and get all the test 
in the Rspec file to pass. We will be adding more complex data structures as we go on. There is a github link for the skeleton 
starter file and rspec test file in the forum. There will be a blind test file to prevent cheating. The blind test file will 
be exactly the same except the values for the nodes will be different.




Hash Table Part 2 - Open Addressing
Tech Stack: Ruby

Challenge Overview
This is the third in a series of challenges of learning computer science data structures in ruby. In the 4th step to this 
challenge is you will create methods to build a hash table. The difference in this hash table is the collision resolution 
technique. The collision resolution method is called open-addressing. You must complete all of the methods (provided) and get 
all the test in the Rspec file to pass. We will be adding more complex data structures as we go on. There is a github link for 
the skeleton starter file and rspec test file in the forum. There will be a blind test file to prevent cheating. The blind test file will be exactly the same except the values for the nodes will be different.
